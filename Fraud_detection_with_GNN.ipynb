Algorithms like the [Louvain method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louvain_method) and [InfoMap](https://towardsdatascience.com/infomap-algorithm-9b68b7e8b86) can identify communities and clusters of users on the graph. However, these methods lack the expressivity to fully consider the graph in its original format.\n",

Through aggregation and message passing, information from both edges and nodes is propagated to neighboring nodes. Multiple layers of graph convolution result in a node's state containing information from nodes multiple layers away, effectively allowing the GNN to have a \"receptive field\" of nodes or edges multiple jumps away from the node or edge in question.\n",

        "1. Transaction Data\n",
        "Any dataset that can be transformed into a graph can be used in our experimental setup. For our research, we used a real-life dataset to construct credit card transaction networks containing millions of transactions. This dataset includes information on the following features: anonymized identification of clients and merchants, merchant category code, country, monetary amount, time, acceptance, and fraud label. This real-life dataset is highly imbalanced and contains only 0.65% fraudulent transactions. Note that the demo data in this repository is artificaly generated for demonstration purposes. The Timeframes component derives the different timeframes for a rolling window setup given a step and window size.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Graph Construction\n",
        "The GraphConstruction component constructs the graphs that will be used by graph representation learners (e.g. FI-GRL and GraphSAGE) to learn node embeddings. We designed the credit card transaction networks as heterogeneous tripartite graphs containing client, merchant and transaction nodes. Because of this tripartite setup, representations can be learned for the transaction nodes. Only the transaction nodes are configured with node features.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. GraphSAGE\n",
        "The HinSAGE code deploys a supervised, heterogeneous implementation of the GraphSAGE framework called HinSAGE, to learn embeddings of the transaction nodes in the aforementioned graphs.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. FI-GRL\n",
        "The FIGRL code learns embeddings of the transaction nodes in the aforementioned graphs using the Fast Inductive Graph Representation Learning Framework. We call the Matlab implementation of FI-GRL from our Jupyter notebooks, which requires an appropriate installation of matlab.engine in the same folder as the notebooks. If you wish to run FI-GRL from Python, please run the following command in Matlab:\n",
        "\n",
        "cd (fullfile(matlabroot,'extern','engines','python'))\n",
        "system('python setup.py install')\n",
        "\n",
        "This will generate a folder in matlabroot\\extern\\engines\\python\\build\\lib called 'matlab' please copy this folder and place it on the same location as the notebook from which you want to call matlab.engine. If you don't know your matlab root, running 'matlabroot' in Matlab will return the appropriate path.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Classifier\n",
        "The penultimate component in our pipeline uses the transaction node embeddings to classify the transaction nodes as fraudulent or legitimate. We chose to rely on XGBoost as a classification model, but other classifiers can easily be implemented.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Evaluation\n",
        "The Evaluation component contains functions for the Lift score, Lift curve and precision-recall curve. We focused on these evaluation metrics given the highly imbalanced nature of our dataset. However, this code can easily be extended to contain other evaluation metrics such as ROC plots."
